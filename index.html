      <p>I am currently studying the Bachelor of Software Engineering at Monash University. I am currently in my third year and aspiring to become a game developer.
        Throughout my educational journey, I have created projects and learnt from them, improving my skills to develop better projects. My goal is to inspire others to
        also create and to either provide entertainment, information or solve real world problems. </p>
